Got it 👍 I’ll clean up the **proposal** by removing all **AI-related parts** (like NLP/AI reframing). Here’s the revised **OCD + Mental Wellness & Digital Detox App Proposal**:

# 🧠 Project Proposal: Mental Wellness & Digital Detox App

---

## 1. Introduction & Background

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and intrusive thoughts affect millions of people worldwide. Around **2–3% of the global population** experiences OCD symptoms. In Sri Lanka, mental health challenges are rising, but **stigma, cost, and limited therapy access** make treatment harder.

At the same time, **digital overuse** (social media, gaming, screen time) fuels stress, poor sleep, and anxiety. Many people—even without OCD—struggle to manage compulsive behaviors linked to digital addiction.

Current apps are either **too generic** (simple meditation or journaling) or focus only on one issue (like screen time). This project aims to create a **holistic mobile application** combining:

* Intrusive thought support (ERP-inspired timers).
* Mood tracking & meditation.
* Digital detox & habit control.
* Family/partner sharing.
* Therapist booking & professional support.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

* **OCD patients** lack structured, affordable tools for daily intrusive thought tracking and response-prevention practice.
* **General users** face stress due to compulsive phone use but lack proper detox frameworks.
* **Families/partners** want to help loved ones but need safe, private ways to stay involved.
* **Therapists** don’t have easy digital summaries of patient progress to guide treatment.

---

## 3. Objectives

1. Provide a **practical digital support tool** for intrusive thought management.
2. Help users **track moods, lifestyle, and meditation habits**.
3. Offer a **digital detox system** for reducing unhealthy behaviors.
4. Enable **partner/family encouragement** without breaching privacy.
5. Create a **therapist connection platform** for professional help.
6. Ensure **privacy, anonymity, and ethical use** of sensitive data.

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1 Core Mental Health Features

* **Intrusive Thought Controller:** Users log intrusive thoughts and set timers to delay responses. Over time, timers increase, helping them break compulsive cycles (ERP principle).
* **Mood Tracker:** Daily ratings (1–10), emotions, and notes.
* **Meditation & Relaxation:** Guided audio/video mindfulness sessions.
* **Daily Reminders:** Push notifications for thought logging and meditation.

### 4.2 Progress & Analytics

* **Dashboard:** Visual graphs of mood and thought trends.
* **Correlation Insights:** Example – poor sleep linked to more intrusive thoughts.
* **Reports & Exports:** Weekly/monthly summaries (PDF) to share with therapists or partners.
* **Gamification:** Streaks, badges, rewards to motivate users.

### 4.3 Advanced & Unique Features

* **Partner/Family Sharing Mode:** Controlled summaries (not full logs) so loved ones can encourage without invading privacy.
* **Crisis/Emergency Mode:** Severe thought logging → calming exercises + hotline numbers + optional partner alerts.
* **Lifestyle Tracking:** Logs for sleep, exercise, caffeine, showing effects on mood.

### 4.4 Digital Detox & Habit Control

* **Bad Habit Logging:** Track social media, smoking, junk food, procrastination.
* **Screen Time Monitoring (Android API):** Measure time spent on apps like Instagram, TikTok.
* **Detox Challenges:** 7-day or 30-day streaks to reduce bad habits.
* **Replacement Habits:** Suggestions (e.g., “10 min meditation instead of scrolling”).
* **Partner Accountability:** Share detox progress with a partner for motivation.

### 4.5 Professional Connection

* **Therapist Directory:** Verified therapists with details (specialty, fees, experience).
* **Booking System:** Appointment booking with reminders.
* **Telehealth (Optional):** Video sessions using third-party APIs.
* **Therapist Mode (Future):** Therapist dashboards for patient summaries (only with consent).

### 4.6 Safety & Ethics

* Disclaimer: *Support tool, not a replacement for therapy*.
* Anonymous logging option.
* Data privacy & encryption.
* Local hotline numbers for emergencies.

## 5. Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** Flutter (cross-platform for Android/iOS).
* **Backend:** Firebase (Auth, Firestore, notifications) OR Node.js + PostgreSQL.
* **Analytics & Reporting:** Recharts/Chart.js + PDF generator.
* **APIs:** Google Digital Wellbeing (screen time), Zoom/Google Meet (telehealth).

---

## 6. Development Timeline (8 Months)

* **Months 1–2:** MVP → intrusive thought logging, mood tracker, meditation module.
* **Months 3–4:** Reports, lifestyle tracking, detox basics, gamification.
* **Months 5–6:** Partner/family sharing, crisis mode, habit logging.
* **Months 7–8:** Therapist directory, booking, polish, testing, pilot run.

---

## 7. Validation & Evaluation

* **Data from daily trackers** to measure user progress.
* **Reports & analytics** showing improved mood trends or reduced thought intensity.
* **Pilot testing** with volunteers for 2–3 weeks.
* **Success metrics:**

  * Reduction in intrusive thought frequency/intensity.
  * Improved average mood scores.
  * Reduced daily screen time.
  * Higher motivation from gamification/partner mode.

---

## 8. Expected Outcomes

* A unique mobile app addressing **intrusive thoughts + digital detox** together.
* Practical tool that can help both OCD patients and general stressed users.
* Validation through measurable mood and behavior improvements.
* Relevant to both **Sri Lanka’s mental health gaps** and **global digital wellbeing needs**.
